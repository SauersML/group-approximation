For every group G and every finite nonempty alphabet A, every injective
cellular automaton tau:A^G -> A^G is surjective. An empty alphabet gives
the trivial empty configuration space and causes no additional case.

A cellular automaton means a continuous equivariant self-map of the full
shift, equivalently a map given by a finite memory set and a local rule.
The topology is the product of the discrete alphabet topologies. A proper
invariant subshift cannot replace the full shift in this statement.

This records the positive goal requested on 2026-09-07. Neither the
repository's nonsofic-group constructions nor a completed dependency
reduction settles it. Its negative Leavitt lane remains separate; a
counterexample there would refute this claim.

## Attempts

The finite-observable approach now yields the quantitative criterion
split-ca-defects-force-linear-observable-rank: a strict encoder has a
positive defect seed generating a tower of dimension n delta. It does
not furnish an upper bound contradicting that growth.
reversible-xor-has-linear-observable-rank disproves the proposed universal
sublinear bound, even for the unique decoder of a bijective automaton.
Another invariant must distinguish defect growth from reversible growth.

The fixed-test-group route below uses the existing reduction honestly:
surjunctivity of the test group itself remains an open prerequisite.

The second attack proves split-decoders-have-generic-cantor-fibers. A
strict encoder forces every local decoder to erase a finite perturbation
and have a Cantor subset in every transitive output fiber. The new route
therefore asks for a decoder with just one countable transitive fiber.
No such universal countability result has been proved. In particular,
large topological fibers do not force positive conditional entropy for
the measure supported on the chosen section; the artifact gives a
rectangular counterexample to that inference.

The quantum extension attack now has exact obstruction bounds in
split-ca-quantization-has-sharp-defect. Compression by the encoder's
isometry is local and unital completely positive, but a strict encoder
would give it a norm-one multiplicative defect and put its range
projection at distance 1/2 from the quasilocal algebra. The universal
extension to a unital homomorphism on full matrix observables remains
an open prerequisite. Locality alone does not supply multiplicativity.

The information-transport attack's proposed exact row identity is false,
even for a reversible two-track involution. A degree-64 tree parity shear
with fully iid source and output pins has a discontinuous conditional
entropy for an interval of source-pin densities; finite-exhaustion reveal
accounting misses a uniformly positive atomic contribution. The artifact
gives the exact posterior reduction and proof. This rules out eliminating
all singular information mass as the universal positive argument. A
comparison of the missing row and column contributions remains open and
does not establish surjunctivity here.

The quadratic-feedback attack proves positive exclusions for arbitrary
bipartite operand graphs, target-multiplicative systems without same-track
quadratic terms, and nearest-two cyclic feedback of every length. A
generalized two-block lemma supplies the common argument. The artifact
also excludes every scalar two-term selector by explicit collision or
reduction to a finite memory subgroup, and gives mixed-triangle controls, including
a track-shift conjugate with distinct spatial pairs that resists the
specified initial elimination moves. The unrestricted conjecture remains
open; escaping those moves is not an injectivity or strictness proof.

The support-preservation argument now covers locally virtually polycyclic
guard subgroups: injectivity forces surjectivity when configurations
supported in unions of their cosets stay in those unions. Finite coset
stratification handles infinite lower-rank intersections and preserves
uniform local recoverability through isolation and cancellation. The
guard reduces to the subgroup generated by its finite memory addresses.
This includes every abelian guard and every scalar finite-field rule
`x(g)+x(gb)P(x)`, for arbitrary local polynomial P. These are positive
class results; unrestricted cellular automata remain open.
