title: Exhibit an explicit non-hyperlinear group
root: true
goal: true
---

The primary target of the program (AGENDA.md header): an explicit group that
is not hyperlinear, i.e. admits no asymptotic embedding into unitary matrices
with the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt metric.

The organizing mechanism is (T)-compression: `Γ ≤ G` with a compressor `t`
(`tΓt⁻¹ ⪇ Γ`). In every category with a conjugation-invariant strictly
monotone size the compression collapses (invariant-size-collapse); the `II₁` branch survives
because the trace is refinement-blind, and that failure is sharp (trace-blindness-sharpness).
The obstruction, if there is one, can only be stability.

## Marked `goal`

Flagged `goal: true` on 2026-08-18, taking the single goal flag over from
`q3-4-resolved`.  The grounds are impact: hyperlinearity is the weakest
standard approximation notion, so this claim is the group-level Connes
embedding problem; a witness subsumes nonsoficity outright (non-hyperlinear
implies nonsofic) and connects to quantum complexity through the LinMIP*
equivalence; and it is the question whose answer is genuinely uncertain,
where Pestov 3.4 has one widely expected answer.  Post-nonsoficity the two
questions are entangled: `hyperlinear-implies-sofic` — Pestov's "yes" —
already routes here via `non-hyperlinear-from-hyperlinear-implies-sofic`,
so even that side's machinery serves this goal.  The separation
(`hyperlinear-nonsofic-group`) remains a root landmark the graph records
and can close; it is deliberately off-goal.

The opposite world is a defined outcome, not a goal branch: a proof that
every group is hyperlinear would be recorded as an established
`every-group-hyperlinear` negation claim, refuting this goal — which per
kernel doctrine is itself a program resolution (the universal question is
answered, and Pestov 3.4 falls negatively for free, since the nonsofic
groups would be hyperlinear).  It is not a branch here because no route
class toward it exists, even speculatively, and partial results cannot
accumulate to it — the same asymmetry `q3-4-resolved` records for its own
affirmative side.

## Ideas

Non-graph brainstorming for this goal goes here. Current periphery: free
independence between branch algebras is NOT excluded by the cross-branch
commutator identity (see docs/OBSTRUCTIONS.md §3, "No commuting branches").
