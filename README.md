# Group Approximation

The remote `verified` branch is automatically fast-forwarded after every complete Lean Prover CI success on `main`. Use that for the most recent correct Lean code.

## A non-MF group

[`non_mf_groups_exist.tex`](non_mf_groups_exist.tex) proves that not every group is MF. [`non_mf_group_notes.tex`](non_mf_group_notes.tex) gives further notes on this.

## Lean library

The Lean code is organized as a reusable library. Generic definitions and theorems are separated from concrete presentations and finite certificates, so other projects can import only the layers they need. [`GroupApproximation.lean`](GroupApproximation.lean) imports the complete library.

| Area | Directories | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Group theory | `Algebra/`, `GroupTheory/`, `Higman/`, `Covers/` | Presentations, normal forms, free products, HNN extensions, quotients, embeddings, and torsion |
| Finite approximation | `Sofic/`, `Criterion/`, `Stability/`, `Domination/`, `Matching/` | MF, sofic, and hyperlinear interfaces; finite models; residuals; matrix coronas; permanence and obstruction theorems |
| Rigidity | `PropertyT/`, `Kazhdan/`, `PropertyTT/` | Fixed-point methods, relative property (T), spectral and Hodge certificates, and property (TT)/T |
| Analysis | `Analysis/`, `KOne/`, `Leavitt/`, `Steinberg/` | Matrix estimates, projections, traces, C*-algebras, K-theory, and noncommutative rings |
| Other group constructions | `Kun/`, `KunThom/`, `Quantum/`, `Monsters/` | Graph, permutation, quantum, and embedding constructions |
| Public and checked interfaces | `Endpoint/`, `Meta/`, `Computability/`, `Manuscript/` | Stable exports, certificate replay, computability wrappers, statement matching, and axiom audits |

Modules named `Literal*` contain fully specified examples and certificate data; the generic modules do not depend on any particular presentation.
